# Project Pantheon

## 1. Project Description

### 1.1 Overview
Pantheon is an experimental AI-driven digital ecosystem where users collaboratively create, govern, and evolve emergent civilizations. Each civilization has its own narrative, belief system, governance, and progression mechanics, shaped by user interactions and AI moderation.

### 1.2 Core Concepts
- **Civilization as a Living Entity**: AI-assisted, self-regulating societies with unique mythologies, laws, and species.
- **AI-Assisted Worldbuilding**: AI aids in defining governance, laws, and cultural evolution.
- **Swarm Intelligence Governance**: AI moderates, ranks, and evaluates all interactions.
- **Promotion & Downgrading System**: Users rise or fall based on AI-driven evaluations.
- **Biomes of Thought**: Users stake support in civilizations, driving their growth.

### 1.3 Philosophy
- **Decentralized AI Governance**: Bottom-up, emergent rule-making instead of top-down control.
- **Cultural Evolution**: Societies grow based on memetic and narrative resonance.
- **Collaborative Storytelling**: Civilizations evolve through collective creativity.

### 1.4 Inspiration
- Reddit-style community building with AI-enforced governance.
- MMO-style ranking and progression.
- Staking-driven civilization support.
- Large-scale mythology and worldbuilding.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Purpose
Pantheon enables users to create AI-assisted civilizations with structured governance, mythology, and progression systems.

**Target Users:**
- Worldbuilders & storytellers
- Decentralized governance enthusiasts
- AI-driven community builders

### 2.2 Scope
- Civilization creation interface
- AI-assisted law and governance structuring
- User staking for civilization influence
- AI-moderated content ranking
- Civilization growth, merging, and diplomatic interactions

### 2.3 Functional Requirements
✅ Civilization creation UI  
✅ AI-powered worldbuilding tools  
✅ User staking & governance model  
✅ AI moderation & ranking system  
✅ Inter-civilization diplomacy and trade  

### 2.4 Sustainability & Anti-PnD Measures
- **Coins** serve as a **creative currency**, not a speculative asset.
- **Earned through contributions**, not bought for financial gain.
- **Must be spent** for influence, project funding, or reputation-building.
- **AI & community-driven safeguards** to prevent market manipulation.

## 3. System Architecture
Pantheon is a decentralized, AI-powered ecosystem built using:
- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Auth**: Privy
- **Storage**: Supabase / IPFS / Arweave
- **AI Backend**: Custom LLMs, RAG system for civilization rule storage
- **AI Moderation & Governance**: LangChain-based agent system
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone for memory and rule enforcement
- **Blockchain**: Solana for staking, governance, and civilization tracking

### 3.1 AI & Governance Stack
- **LLMs**: GPT-4 / Claude / Deepseek (cost-optimized)
- **AI Moderation & Feedback Loop**: Adaptive AI behavior based on past interactions
- **Memory Storage**: Vector databases for long-term civilization data
